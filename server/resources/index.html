                Watchword Chat is a semi-anonymous online chatting website developed by Jinyi Zhou. Here you can chat
                with users who enter the same passcode ("watchword") as you do.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can choose any word that contains only lower case English alphabets as your watchword. Both your
                alias and watchword shouldn't contain space. Also notice that you can only chat with others using basic
                English letters and common punctuations.
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep the chat interesting, you won't know the exact number of people who have said the same
                watchword before you did so. However, they will be informed when you say their watchword. They will also
                receive message when you close the website and go back to reality. However, you can always go back by
                saying the same watchword to reconnect with them :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter your alias and watchword and have fun here!
            </p>
